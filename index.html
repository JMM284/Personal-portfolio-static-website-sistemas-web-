      <h2>About me</h2>  
  <p>
    I‚Äôm a full-stack developer who thrives on turning ideas into functional and visually engaging digital products. 
    My toolkit includes React.js, Node.js, and other modern web technologies, but what really excites me is the 
    process of solving problems and crafting smooth user experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn‚Äôt start my career with a clear plan‚ÄîI simply enjoyed experimenting with code and design. 
    Over time, that curiosity grew into a profession, and today I‚Äôve had the chance to contribute to projects 
    ranging from small startups to larger applications. Each step along the way has taught me something new, 
    and I carry those lessons into every challenge I take on.
  </p>

  <p>
    I care deeply about building software that feels intuitive and reliable. Whether I‚Äôm sketching out a new 
    interface, fine-tuning backend logic, or collaborating with a team, my goal is always the same: deliver 
    something that people genuinely enjoy using.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll probably find me exploring new tools, reading about design trends, or connecting 
    with other developers online. I like to think of myself as a continuous learner, always chasing the next 
    idea that can make me a better builder.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Some quick bits about me:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Background in computer engineering</li>
    <li>Independent and collaborative worker</li>
    <li>Passionate about clean, scalable solutions</li>
    <li>Always open to learning and sharing</li>
