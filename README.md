# Personal Portfolio

This project is a **personal portfolio** developed as a practice assignment for the Web Systems course.  
The task involved **replicating an existing curriculum design** obtained from Figma, adding our own data, and adapting the content to reflect our personal and professional information wherever possible, while inventing information in other areas.

The website is **static** and organized into the following main sections:

- **Personal Information**: brief introduction, contact info social media links and an about me.
- **Skills**: technical tools and competencies.
- **Work Experience**: previous jobs and responsibilities.
- **Projects**: examples of projects.
- **Testimonials**: feedback from people.

Additionally, the project features a **responsive design**, allowing the portfolio to display correctly on **mobile devices and desktops**, adapting the layout according to the screen size.
